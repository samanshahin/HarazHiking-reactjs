# About the project

This project is about [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and Store in ReactJS based on a real project and a book named Haraz Hiking and attractions published in Iran. It was developed in [ReactJS + Redux](https://redux.js.org/) with css parts imported from [Bootstrap's Album example](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/examples/). I use store and AdminCode to prevent others to enter data to the store.
You can just use these files and folders:
#### index.js
#### App.js
#### Items folder
#### data folder
#### store folder

## npm commands

creating a ReactJS project:

### `npx create-react-app you_app_name`

After coding:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\

You need to install these:

### `npm install react-redux`
### `npm install redux`
### `npm install @reduxjs/toolkit`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
